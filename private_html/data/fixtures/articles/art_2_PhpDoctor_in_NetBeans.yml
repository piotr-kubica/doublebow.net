    abstract: |
      When working with NetBeans when developing web applications you may need a
      documetation generating tool which allows you to generate fast your applications
      documentation. PhpDoctor is an useful tool for simple generation of java-like
      looking documentation. There a simple way to integrate those two tools.

      <h3>Why should I document my code?</h3>
      <p>
        Documenting code is an important part of application development. It
        clarifies the code you're writing, especially when your working in a team.
        Not only the code should be readable by others. Documentations helps to
        understand a piece of code that you don't won't to read entirely,
        because it might be to long. There are also some <b>good practices</b> that
        you should know before writing documentation. Here are some
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Documentation_Practice">good practices</a>
        for writing it.
      </p>
      <h3>Time to integrate - Download and install PhpDoctor</h3>
      <p>
        Open your bowser and download PhpDoctor from
        <a href="http://peej.github.com/phpdoctor/#download">this site</a>
        Now extract downloaded file to your <b>project directory</b> and rename the folder to <b>doc</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Create documentation trough NetBeans IDE</h3>
      <p>
        Run NetBeans and right click on project icon in <b>Projects</b> window to
        <b>Set Configuration &gt; Customize...</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="/images/assets/a002/p1.png" alt="symfony customization" />
      </p>
      <p>Add a new cofiguration named <b>create_doc</b></p>
      <p>Select <b>Run As</b> <b>Script</b></p>
      <p>
        Select Index File by clicking <b>Browse...</b> and open <b>phpdoc.php</b>
        that you will find in the previous renamed folder - <b>doc</b> (located in your project directory)
      </p>
      <p>
        In the argument filed write your configuration file (contains settings for PhpDoctor)
        name, for example <b>default.ini</b> (this configuration will create documentation
        of PhpDoctor itself)
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="/images/assets/a002/p2.png" alt="project configuration" />
      </p>
      <p class="warning">
        <b>Note!!</b><br/>
        You should create your own configuration file. Copy <b>default.ini</b>
        and rename it. Change value of <b>source_path</b> parameter to tell PhpDoctor where to look
        for php file that will be documented. Change value of <b>d</b> parameter to tell PhpDoctor
        in what directory the documentation should be created. Read about
        <a href="http://peej.github.com/phpdoctor/more.html#configuration">configuration directives</a></p>
      </p>
      <p>Set project configuration to <b>create_doc</b> and <b>run main project</b> to create documentation</p>
      <p>
        <img src="/images/assets/a002/p3.png" alt="run" />
      </p>
