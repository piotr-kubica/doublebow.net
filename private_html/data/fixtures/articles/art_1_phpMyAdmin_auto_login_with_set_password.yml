    abstract: |
      To manage your database you can use the system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">
      command line</a>, but there's also a handy tool called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpMyAdmin">
      phpMyAdmin</a>. It allows you to work with your database in an user-friendly environment. So why not use it?

      <h3>Run phpMyAdmin</h3>
      <p>
        phpMyAdmin comes with <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WampServer</a> installation. You can also install
        it separately. After you've installed WampServer on Windows7/Vista/XP and started your server, you can easily access phpMyAdmin by
        clicking the WampServer icon in the notification area and choosing from the menu phpMyAdmin. It will open in your default browser.

      <h3>phpMyAdmin security warning</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you may notice are some alert at the bottom of phpMyAdmin site that look like tihs:
      </p>
      <div class="code_snippet"><pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false;">
        Your configuration file contains settings (root with no password)
        that correspond to the default MySQL privileged account. Your
        MySQL server is runnin with this default, is open to intrusion,
        and you really should fix this security hole by setting a
        password for user '.root'.
      </pre></div>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <div>
        To get rid of it you should set a password to the user root.
        Go to the <b>Privileges tab</b> (located at the top of your phpMyAdmin site).
        You will see all users that have access to MySQL. Click on the <b>Edit Privileges</b>
        icon in the last column where the User is root. Scroll down a bit. You will see a<b>
        Change password</b> form. In this form select the <b>Password</b> radio button
        and fill in your password. After you've done that click on <b>Go</b>.
      </div>
      <h4>#1045 - Access denied</h4>
      <p>
        Close your browser. If you try now to reload phpMyAdmin by typing in
        <a href="../phpmyadmin/index.php">http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php</a> (assuming you installed wamp with default settings)
        errors will appear. The error message will be following:
      </p>
      <div class="code_snippet"><pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false;">#1045 - Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)</pre></div>
      <p>
        Go to your wamp installation. The default for Windows is <b>c:\wamp</b>. Go to <b>apps\phpmyadmin3.2.0.1\</b>
        and find the file <b>confing.inc.php</b>. Open it.
      <p>
      <p>In this file find a line</p>
      <div class="code_snippet"><pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false;">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '';</pre></div>
      <p>Write in between the apostrophes your password. For example write <b>1234</b>, so it looks like this:</p>
      <div class="code_snippet"><pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false;">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '1234';</pre></div>
      <p>
        Save this file and reload phpMyAdmin. It should load without the logon screeen but the root user is password protected.
      </p>
